#RS-232 Serial Communication Setup

= Introduction =

The mini2440 provides a serial port for console output. As such, a terminal emulator is required to communicate with the board.

*Serial Port Configuration 115k (8/N/1)*
  * BAUD-Rate: 115 kbps
  * Flow-Control: None
  * Parity: None
  * Size: 8 bits

== Terminal Emulators ==

While Windows has polished programs like Hyperterm and Teraterm for terminal emulation, linux terminal emulation is typically done from the command line (terminal). 

As such, several different options exist for terminal emulators in a linux environment: 
  * [http://freshmeat.net/projects/minicom/ Minicom]
  * [http://freshmeat.net/projects/picocom/ Picocom]
  * [http://www.airs.com/ian/uucp.html UUCP]

As done [http://code.google.com/p/mini2440/wiki/MiniBringup here], the Picocom terminal emulator will be used.

=== Installing Picocom ===

While you can build Picocom from source it is recommended that you install it from your linux distributions package manager (e.g. Yum, Apt, etc.).
  * sudo yum install picocom
  * sudo apt-get install picocom
  * sudo emerge picocom

If you are not on the sudoers list and get a nasty message go [http://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-add-a-user-to-the-sudoers-list/ here] and try again or become root via 'su'.


=== Using Picocom ===

The first serial port on a PC (COM1) is typically assigned to /dev/ttyS0. Similarly, when using a USB-to-Serial adapter the port is typically at /dev/ttyUSB0.

To connect to the mini2440 via COM1:

{{{
someone@something ~ $ sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyS0 --send-cmd "sx -vv"
}}}

Note: It *may not* be necessary to execute the above with elevated privileges depending on your platform. 

As a matter of convenience, the above command can be put into a bash script and saved somewhere convenient (e.g. /home/user/bin).

To do this, open a text editor such as gedit or vim and type the following:
{{{
#!/bin/bash
exec su -c 'picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyS0 --send-cmd "sx -vv"'
}}}

Save the file as 'miniconsole' to '/home/$USER/bin' where $USER is your user name. By default the file will not be executable. As such, do the following:
{{{
someone@something ~ $ cd /home/someone/bin
someone@something ~/bin $ chmod +x miniconsole
}}}

The above can be verified by doing:
{{{
someone@something ~ $ ls -l `which miniconsole`
-rwxr-xr-x 1 someone users 75 2009-09-06 12:40 /home/someone/bin/miniconsole
}}}
If miniconsole is not found then its location isn't in your $PATH. To temporarily fix this the directory can be appended to your $PATH via:
{{{
someone@something ~ $ export PATH=$PATH:/home/someone/bin
}}}
However, an entry should be put in your .bashrc file to ensure that the directory is always added to your $PATH when you login. Go [http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/sample-bashrc.html here] for more information regarding the .bashrc file.
